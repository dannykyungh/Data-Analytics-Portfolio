# Data-Analytics-Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio! I’m Daniel Harwood, a data analyst with a robust academic background that includes a double major in Economics and Chinese, supplemented by ongoing studies toward an online Master of Public Health (MPH) at George Washington University. This diverse foundation has equipped me with analytical rigor, a global perspective, and a strategic mindset essential for impactful data work. My professional experience spans significant roles in the non-profit sector, most notably at New York Common Pantry, where I led the creation of dashboards and tracking tools for non-technical staff, enabling efficient program monitoring and streamlined reporting.

In my role at New York Common Pantry, I developed and deployed comprehensive dashboards and reports that informed senior management’s decision-making and provided critical updates to key stakeholders on organizational progress. Leveraging tools like Python, R, SQL, Power BI, Tableau, and Excel, I excelled in data visualization, data cleaning, data modeling, and data warehousing. My ability to merge complex data sources and present them in clear, actionable formats has been pivotal in translating data into strategic insights that drive program success and enhance operational efficiency.

I bring a strong mix of technical expertise, strategic problem-solving, and collaborative experience to every project. I am skilled at turning complex datasets into impactful narratives that highlight trends, identify challenges, and illuminate opportunities for growth. My work embodies not just technical proficiency but the capacity to deliver data-driven solutions that resonate with diverse audiences and inform meaningful action. I invite you to explore my portfolio to see firsthand how my skills and experience align with your needs.
